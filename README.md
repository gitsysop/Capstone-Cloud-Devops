# Capstone-Cloud-Devops
Project Overview

In this project I applied the skills and knowledge I developed throughout the Cloud DevOps Nanodegree program. These include:

- Working in AWS
- Using Jenkins to implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
- Building pipelines
- Building Kubernetes clusters
- Building Docker containers in pipelines

I developed a CI/CD pipeline for microservices applications with rolling deployment. I developed Continuous Integration steps such as “linting” and also Continuous Deployment steps like:

- Pushing the built Docker containers to the Docker repository
- Deploying these Docker containers to a small Kubernetes cluster. For Kubernetes cluster I used AWS EKS.
